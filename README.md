🧪 Atomic Splitter
Atomic Splitter is a strategic 2-player chain-reaction game built with Python and Pygame. Inspired by the classic Chain Reaction concept, it features dynamic animations, explosion effects, particle systems, and a real-time turn-based timer—designed to provide a visually engaging and competitive experience.

🎮 Gameplay
Players take turns placing orbs on a grid.

When a cell exceeds its critical mass, it explodes—sending orbs to adjacent cells, potentially causing chain reactions.

A player can only add orbs to empty cells or cells they already occupy.

The game ends when one player eliminates all of the opponent's orbs.

✨ Features
🔁 Chain Reactions: Automatically cascades explosions with smooth animations.

⏱️ Turn Timers: Each player has a countdown timer—strategize fast!

🌟 Particle Effects: Exploding orbs emit beautiful particle trails.

🎨 Custom Visuals: Semi-transparent colors, smooth graphics, and interactive cell highlighting.

👥 2 Player Support: Local turn-based play with player name customization.
